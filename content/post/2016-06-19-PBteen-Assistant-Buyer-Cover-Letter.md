Dear PBteen Team, 

I believe that the home should be a sanctuary, a place that inspires you, calms you and is an overall reflection of your life.  I have always had an interest in home decor (when I was little I always had graph paper and measuring tape on hand to figure out all the different ways I could rearrange my bedroom) and spend an embarrassing amount of time scouring blogs and Pinterest for the latest home design and decor trends.  I want to bring this enthusiasm along with my previous buying and inventory management experience to the PBteen team as the Assistant Buyer of bedroom furniture.

As Manager/Buyer/Visual Merchandiser/Jack-of-all-Trades for a local network of brick-and-mortar fast fashion boutiques I am experienced in leading teams, coordinating calendars and analyzing markets.  As the Buyer for Ideele, our continued success depends on my ability to identify and react  to trends to drive sales. We make biweekly trips to Los Angeles to procure new styles and source new brands and have a very limited timeframe for buying, which has enabled me to become a quick and confident decision maker in a fast-paced, ever-changing work environment while managing inventory across all phases of the merchandising cycle including reorders, backorders, and markdowns.

As a manager I put good service and dedication above all else and prefer to work alongside my sales team, leading by example. I am a highly detail oriented person and my organizational skills are displayed on a daily basis through building the store schedules, handling payroll, coordinating buying trips and appointments, all while overseeing the cleanliness and order of store floor, helping customers and replenishing stock. I often go well and beyond what is required (from getting on my hand and knees to clean the floor to coming in early on my day off to execute sales-driving floor moves) which is why I was quickly promoted from a Sales Associate to Manager/Buyer/Merchandiser. I take pride in executing all aspects of my job to the best of my ability and would bring this mentality to the Merchandising team. 

I believe my energy, eye for design and trends, strong attention to detail and buying experience will greatly contribute to PBteen team.  I'm excited to learn buying on a larger scale and I look forward to contributing my skills and dedication to the Assistant Buyer position and hope to speak to you further about how I can be an asset to your team.  

Sincerely, 

Megan Sullivan
